          Hi, I'm Jeni Boberâ€”an aspiring product manager with a background in personalized customer
          care from diverse sectors such as public service, fashion, and real estate. Currently, I'm
          moving towards product management, driven by my passion for collaboration and
          problem-solving. As a student of life, I thrive on learning and am eager to bring my
          enthusiasm to your team. In my free time, I enjoy crafting miniatures and hitting the
          slopes for some snowboarding fun.
